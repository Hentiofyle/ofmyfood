OhMyFood is an online menu for restaurant 

This is a website with 4 pages that advertises a menu of a restaurant in Paris. 
It's a non functioning website but i'm planning of adding a contact section and make the "order" button trigger a reservation form. 

This is a project for my degree in web development specialize in Frontend JavaScript React.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fontawesome for the icons

### What I learned

throught this project i updated and push my CSS animations skils to the next lvl and learned how to do a loading spinner. 
I practiced KeyFrames, translate and rotate property. 


### Continued development

As i said in the section above, i would like to improve the project by adding form and contact options that send email to the restaurant any time a customer want to make a reservation. 
The email would contain the information about the customers and their choice, to make the experiences better and remove any useless wait at the restaurant.

This helped me for having a better understanding of CSS animations. 

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSULWGtM1r4] - This is an amazing youtube tutorial which helped me using CSS Elipsis property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
